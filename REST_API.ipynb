    "\n",
    "FAO's web portal to monitor Water Productivity through Open-access of Remotely sensed derived data (WaPOR). This portal covers Africa and the Near East, with remotely sensed data, to monitor, in near real time, agricultural water and land productivity as well carbon dioxide uptake by vegetation.\n",

    "## REST API\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style and set of conventions used for building web services. It defines a set of guidelines and principles for designing networked applications that can be accessed and interacted with over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mWDnkS0dDo) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReST API documentation for accessing WaPOR database can be found at: https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/swagger-ui.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## This tutorial\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use FAO ReST API with Python scripting to access the WaPOR database.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST defines a set of standardized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform actions on resources. Additionally, RESTful APIs often utilize common data formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for data representation.\n",
    "We're going to use the **requests** and **json** packages to connect to the database and we're going to use the **matplotlib** **pandas** and **rasterio** packages to visualize the downloaded daata. Make sure that these packages are installed in your conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Token\n",
    "For some functions, you will need an API Token to authorize your access. Follow the steps below to get your API Token:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Sign up/Log in an account on WaPOR portal\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://wapor.apps.fao.org/, click **Sign in**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/1_signin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have an account, create a new account, then log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2:  Create API\n",
    "\n",
    "After logging in, go to **My WaPOR** > **My Profile** \n",

    "Under **API Token**, click **Generate API Token**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./img/4_generatetoken.png)\n",
